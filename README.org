* Overview

Full-stack web engineer with production experience across the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem.
I care about typed interfaces, clear separation between layers, and codebases that remain readable as they scale.
Most of my professional work lives in private repositories. This profile contains personal projects that reflect how I approach software design.

* Stack

+ *Languages:* TypeScript, Python, Rust
+ *Frontend:* Vue/Nuxt, React/Next, SvelteKit
+ *Backend:* Node.js, RESTful API design, relational and graph databases
+ *Tooling & Environment:* Linux, Docker, Git

* What I Focus On

+ Designing component systems and UI architectures that scale without becoming fragile
+ Maintaining typed contracts across client, server, and data layers
+ Refactoring incrementally in production, improving structure without stalling delivery
+ Keeping state management, data access, and presentation cleanly separated
+ Working comfortably across the stack, from database schema to deployed frontend
