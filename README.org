* Tomás Bizet

Web Developer with professional experience building and maintaining production web applications.

Most of my day-to-day work is in private repositories. This profile contains selected personal projects that reflect how I structure and approach software outside of work.

* Engineering Focus

+ Full-stack TypeScript development (Vue/Nuxt, React/Next, Node.js)
+ Designing scalable UI architectures and reusable component systems
+ Defining and maintaining typed data contracts across client and server
+ Designing and integrating RESTful backend services
+ Modeling and querying relational and graph databases
+ Refactoring legacy systems toward clearer boundaries and long-term maintainability
+ Balancing delivery speed with sustainable system design

* Approach

+ Building codebases that remain understandable as they grow
+ Maintaining consistent type guarantees across application layers
+ Keeping UI, state management, and data access clearly separated
+ Refactoring safely and incrementally in production environments
+ Making pragmatic trade-offs between short-term delivery and long-term maintainability
